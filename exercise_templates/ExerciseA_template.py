#Exercise A

# Assumption 1: indexing
# It is assumed in the answers below that the descriptions that
# "row 1" means the first row i.e. 0th index in Python
# "element (2,2)" means the 2nd row, 2nd column in Python, i.e. indices 1,1.
# Assumption 2: cumulative effects
#  The changes in each line of within an Exercise may affect the answers in later parts of the exercise.
#  e.g. change to A.3b will affect the resulting matrix 'a' of A.3d.
