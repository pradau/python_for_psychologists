#### Scatter plot



#regression line where scores A and B are combined



#obtain the fit parameters from linear regression

#obtain the function that represents the fit and can generate new values.

#plot fit as a green line



#### Bar graph


#this is the standard error (assuming this group of students is the entire pop.)


#put in tuples for graphing




#### Histograms
#arrangement of subplots



#number of histogram bins. Lower number is a more coarse histogram. (e.g. 20 is fine)



#calculate an upper limit from all the scores, and round to nearest 10.
